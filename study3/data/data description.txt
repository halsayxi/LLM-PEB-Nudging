Dataset Description: 16-Day Longitudinal Experiment on Pro-Environmental Nudges

This dataset comes from a 16-day longitudinal experiment designed to examine how different types and intensities of nudges affect pro-environmental behavior. Each row represents a single participant and includes demographic characteristics, baseline measures, daily willingness and behavior reports, reaction times, and post-test outcomes.

1. Participant Demographics (from Day 1 Pre-Test Survey)
• Age: Age in years
• Sex: Gender (e.g., “Male”, “Female”)
• Ethnicity: Self-reported ethnicity, including Asian, Black, White, Mixed and Other
• Nationality: Nationality of the participant
• Occupation: Job type
1 = Student
2 = Government or public sector employee
3 = Private sector employee
4 = Freelancer or self-employed
5 = Other
• Income: Income level
1 = Less than £10,000
2 = £10,001 – £20,000
3 = £20,001 – £30,000
4 = £30,001 – £40,000
5 = £40,001 – £60,000
6 = Above £60,000
7 = Prefer not to say
• Education (Education level):
1 = Primary school or below
2 = Middle school
3 = High school
4 = Associate degree
5 = Bachelor’s degree
6 = Master’s degree
7 = Doctorate

2. Experimental Variables
• ID: Unique participant identifier
• group: Assigned experimental condition (e.g., assistant_high, infor_low, control)

3. Baseline (Pre-Test) Variables
• envSelfEfficacy_pre: Environmental self-efficacy at baseline
• envAttitude_pre: Environmental attitudes at baseline
• envMotivation_pre: Environmental motivation at baseline

4. Daily Measures (Day 1–Day 16)
• scenarioN_willingness_dayX: Willingness rating in scenario N (N = 1–5, X = 1–16)
• scenarioN_behavior_dayX: Reported behavior in scenario N
• *_rt_dayX: Reaction time for willingness and behavior questions
• nudge_assi_rt_dayX / nudge_inform_rt_dayX: Response time for interactive nudges (if applicable)

5. Post-Test Variables (Day 16)
• envSelfEfficacy_post: Environmental self-efficacy at post-test
• envAttitude_post: Environmental attitudes after the intervention
• envMotivation_post: Environmental motivation after the intervention
• nudge_acceptance_post: Self-reported acceptance and favorability of the nudge
• nudge_reactance_post: Self-reported resistance or negative reaction to the nudge
• nudge_fatigue_post: Self-reported fatigue to the nudge
