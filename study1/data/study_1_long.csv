Here are four practical and motivating tips to save water:
1. Wash fruits in a bowl instead of under running water！you can save a significant amount of water each time.
2. Turn off the tap while soaping your hands or doing laundry！each time you save 10-30 liters, which adds up quickly!
3. Try shortening your shower time！most sailors finish in under 1 minute. You'll not only save water but also have more time for other activities!
